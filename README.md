# What is (was) queer_hack_2020?

"queer_hack_2020" was a code jam for students in the LGBTQ+ population that occurred in December of 2020. It lasted 48 hours, and encouraged students to make connections while also having fun.

# What is this submission?

This submission, officially titled "I-Care", was developed by myself (Aaron Schwartz), Tim Smith, and Misty Houle. It is a mobile app developed with Android Studio that combines a to-do list with Tamagotchi.
The app "checks in" on users each day when started up, with a customizable list of questions. If the user has completed their tasks for the day, they are given currency which can be used to buy accessories for their pet.

I-Care won queer_hack_2020's "Best Hack for Social Good", making it one of 5 winners.

# Notes
Because it was made within 48 hours, and several team members had never learned Android before, the app is far from fully complete. That being said, I believe what is there is a solid proof-of-concept.
